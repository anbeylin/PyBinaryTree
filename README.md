# PyBinaryTree
*Python implementation of Binary Tree data structure*

This is a smlal project I started as a test to learn how to use GitHub, and  to write my own Binary Tree implementation.

I plan to implement several different types of Binary trees:

1. Basic Binary tree
2. Red-Black tree
3. AVL tree
4. 2-3 tree
